# FD-Based Credit Card System on Web3

## Overview

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) that implements a Fixed Deposit (FD) based credit card system on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts. It includes a frontend for user interaction and a smart contract for handling the business logic.

## Features

- **Fixed Deposit (FD) Based Credit Card**: Users can lock their funds in a fixed deposit to get a credit limit on their card.
- **Web3 Integration**: The dApp is integrated with Web3, allowing it to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Smart Contract**: The business logic of the FD-based credit card system is implemented in a smart contract.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Metamask

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the local development server

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

2. Connect your Metamask wallet

3. Interact with the dApp through the frontend

## Smart Contract

The smart contract for the FD-based credit card system is written in Solidity. It handles the creation of FDs, calculation of credit limit, and transactions on the credit card.
